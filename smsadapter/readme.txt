Inbound SMS

Twilio places no limitation on the rate at which a number can receive SMS messages. 
Twilio will make an HTTP request to the request URL for each message received at your Twilio number. 
Therefore, please make sure your server is capable of handling the load if you are expecting a large amount of 
concurrent inbound traffic.


Outgoing SMS on Long Codes

Based on the destination youâ€™re reaching, your messages will be processed at different rates.
If your application is making requests faster than the rate mentioned below, your messages will be placed in a queue 
and processed accordingly.
